- The Open aRtifact Classification and Analysis (ORCA) framework is a system that enables both cyber security analysts and researchers to perform data mining tasks on data collected from vast repositories of malicious artifacts. 
- The system is designed to be both modular and extensible. Each component of the system can be replaced or expanded to fit the organizational needs of the customer. 
- Cyber security analysts and operators utilize the efficient search and data exploration features of ORCA to quickly identify similar samples to an unknown target sample and discover candidates for detection rule creation. 
- Data scientists utilize ORCA to create classification models to identify malware families, determine sample disposition, and other arbitrary data mining tasks. 
- Performance evaluations of ORCA have shown it is a viable framework for creating meaningful classification models. In test, we were able to predict a sample’s disposition with 93% accuracy. This level of accuracy is significant in real world applications where static signature do not exist.
- Future work for the ORCA project will include developing a production environment, integrating standards such as STIX/TAXII protocols and developing many additional machine learning models.
